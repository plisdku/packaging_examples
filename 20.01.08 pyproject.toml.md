## Specifying minimum build system requirements for Python projects

https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/

How should packages specify build dependencies necessary to execute their chosen build system?

A new configuration file is introduced for software packages to use to specify their build dependencies (with the expectation that the same configuration file will be used for future configuration details).

**The trouble is that you can't execute a `setup.py` file without knowing its dependencies, but currently there is no standard way to know what those dependencies are in an automated fashion without excuting the `setup.py` file where that information is stored.**

Setuptools tried to solve this with the `setup_requires` arg to `setup()` but it doesn't solve the problem really.  (Obviously.)  So nobody even uses `setup_requires`.  Often people just document elsewhere what should be manually installed before building.

### Rough steps to produce a build artifact for a project
1. The source checkout of the project
2. Installation of the build system
3. Execute the build system

### Specification

A file named `pyproject.toml` written in TOML format.

> TOML aims to be a minimal configuration file format that's easy to read due to obvious semantics. TOML is designed to map unambiguously to a hash table. TOML should be easy to parse into data structures in a wide variety of languages.

Why TOML: more human-usable than JSON, it is flexible, and not overly-complex like YAML.  TOML is used in the Rust community for their Cargo package manager and they love it.  The PEP authors admit that this choice is subjective and they happen to prefer TOML.

For the majority of Python projects using setuptools, `pyproject.toml` will be

```
[build-system]
# Minimum requirements for the build system to execute.
requires = ["setuptools", "wheel"]  # PEP 508 specifications.
```

Build tools are expected to use the example config file as their default semantics when a `pyproject.toml` is not present!!!

Tools should not require the existence of the `[build-system]` table, in which case the default values should be used.

The `[tool]` table is where any tool related to the Python project, not just build tools, can have users specify configuration data as long as they use a sub-table within `[tool]` _e.g._ `[tool.flit]` for the flit tool.  Also a best practice, their rule is that if may use the subtable `tool.xyz` iff they own the entry for `xyz` in the Cheeseshop/PyPI.

PEP-0518 considers many other options for namespaces, table names, file formats, and details their reasoning.  I love this so much.

- JSON is a great data exchange format but not editing-friendly, and no comments
- YAML has an 86 page spec among other issues (arbitrary code execution too)
- configparser is INI style, but there is no spec for the INIs.
- Python literals: a dict as the config format.  JSON with comments.  Harder to interpret without Python.
- setup.cfg: .ini files, and schema was never rigorously defined.
